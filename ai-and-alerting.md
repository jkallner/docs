# AI-Assisted Alert Optimization: Scoring, Refining, and Pruning

## Background

In modern operational environments, engineers frequently encounter overwhelming volumes of alerts, many lacking actionability. This phenomenon, known as **alert fatigue**, significantly hampers operational effectiveness, reliability, and morale (Gartner, 2023).

Alert fatigue arises when engineers face excessive, redundant, or non-actionable notifications, increasing the likelihood of missing critical incidents and causing delayed responses. Gartner indicates that up to **80% of alerts** in some organizations are considered **non-actionable**, contributing significantly to alert fatigue (Gartner, 2023). On-call engineers frequently report experiencing **burnout due to constant interruptions**, significantly affecting morale and productivity (Opsgenie, 2024).

Alert fatigue does not only lead to missed or delayed responses—it also degrades **alert accuracy** over time. Engineers become conditioned to ignore frequent alerts, increasing the chances of missing **critical incidents**. Additionally, **false positives and redundant alerts** contribute to noise, making it difficult to distinguish between real and non-urgent issues (PagerDuty, 2024).

Beyond fatigue and accuracy concerns, poor alerting practices result in **missed alerts**—those that should have triggered action but failed due to unclear conditions or lack of visibility. This lack of reliability in alerting can directly **impact uptime and service availability**, leading to negative business consequences (Splunk, 2024).

From an **organizational standpoint**, unmanaged alert fatigue leads to increased **burnout, higher turnover rates**, and declining **operational efficiency**. For leadership, the consequences extend to **degraded system reliability, impaired customer satisfaction, and financial losses** due to service disruptions (Harvard Business Review, 2024).

Given these challenges, organizations must adopt **structured methodologies** to improve **alert actionability, accuracy, and effectiveness**. This paper explores best practices for alert refinement, the implementation of a structured scoring rubric, and the role of **AI-driven insights** in optimizing alerting processes.
